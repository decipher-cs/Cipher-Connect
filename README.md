## ToDo

- [ ] Show ghost text when user types (not good performance but would look really good).
- [ ] Send a private message to yourself.
- [ ] Extract list function from TemproratyDrawer into a separate component.
- [ ] A loader/ spinner for each element that depends on fetching data from server.
- [ ] Remove abstraction from TemporaryDrawer, It is causing unnecessary confusion.
