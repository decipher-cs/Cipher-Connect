## ToDo

- [ ] Show ghost text when user types (not good for performance but it would look really nice).
- [ ] Send a private message to yourself.
- [x] Extract list function from TemproratyDrawer into a separate component.
- [ ] A loader/ spinner for each element that depends on fetching data from server.
- [x] Remove abstraction from TemporaryDrawer, It is causing unnecessary confusion. 
- [x] DO NOT SEND OTHER PEOPLE'S PASSWORD HASHS TO OTHER USERS!!! (How did this even happen??)
- [ ] userRooms in backend should be stored in a set (or something similar) not an array.
- [x] Ensure a room without participants can not exist OR run a scheduled job in DB to delete all rooms without participants.
- [ ] Might wanna use a library like [promise-retry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/promise-retry) to re-run failed queries to DB.
- [x] Add support for group chat.
- [ ] Break text into multiple lines when a single word has too many characters and overflows.
